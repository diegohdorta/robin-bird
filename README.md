_Robin Bird_ is a small _Machine Learning_ library, fully experimental,
written in _C++_ for learning purpose only. This library provides simple
implementations of _Machine Learning_ algorithms for solving real world
problems on embedded systems. These algorithms are released as simple command-line
programs and classes which can be used and integrated into low to medium-scale
_Machine Learning_ solutions.
