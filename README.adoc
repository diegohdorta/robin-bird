== RB&#8482;

_Robin Bird_ is a small _Machine Learning_ library, fully experimental, written in
_C++_ for learning purpose only. This library provides simple implementations of
_Machine Learning_ algorithms for solving real world problems on embedded systems.

These algorithms are released as simple command-line programs and classes which
can be used and integrated into low to medium-scale _Machine Learning_ solutions.
