=== Robin Bird Overview

Check if `Robin Bird` is installed by:

[source,bash]
----
$ pkg-config robin --libs
----

The output must be:

[source,bash]
----
-L/usr/local/lib -lrobin
----

==== Sample

Create a simple `.cpp` file and use the following example to test if the library
is working properly:

[source,c]
----
#include <iostream>
#include <time.h>

#include <robin/robin-nn.h>

static double random(double x);

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    if (argc < 2) {
        std::cout << "Missing matrix size" << std::endl;    
        return 0;
    }
    
    double size = atof(argv[1]);
    srand(time(NULL));
    Matrix <double> A(size, size), B(size, size);

    A = A.applyFunction(random);
    B = B.applyFunction(random);

    std::cout << "Matrix A:\n" << A << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Matrix B:\n" << B << std::endl;

    std::cout << "Matrix A + B:\n" << A + B << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Matrix A * B:\n" << A.dot(B) << std::endl;
    
    std::cout << "Matrix A(1,1): "<< A(0,0) << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Matrix A(" << size << "," << size << "): "
              << A(size - 1, size -1) << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}

static double random(double x)
{
    return (double)(rand() % 10000 + 1)/10000;
}
----

Compile it:

[source,bash]
----
$ g++ sample.cpp `pkg-config robin --libs --cflags`
----

Run the example:

[source,bash]
----
$ ./a.out
----

==== Handwritten Digit

The MNIST is most commonly database used for handwritten digits examples, however
to create a database is not complicate, here a picture was convert into gray scale,
then all the black spots receives one and the white ones receives zero, as follows:

Here is a simple 32x32 (1024 pixels) image that was convert into gray scale:

image::assets/number.png[sample]

After that it was applied a script to turn the black spots into one and the white
spots into zero, the result is the following data:

image::assets/bw_number.png[example]

For this experimental test was taken about 1000 number pictures and applied the
above method to generate the  following datasets:

* https://raw.githubusercontent.com/diegohdorta/robin-bird/master/robin/models/hwd-digits-train.rb?token=ACQLYQSRU2BR5NU7KE4XVPS5GX5A4[936 images for training];
* https://raw.githubusercontent.com/diegohdorta/robin-bird/master/robin/models/hwd-digits-test.rb?token=ACQLYQSPIU5UHWW4LVEZSVS5GX5CM[10 images for training].

You can create your own dataset including the 32x32 convert to black and white
spots followed by a properly label.

==== Training and Testing

With those black and white images it is possible to start computing the model.
Download the datasets from the previous section with 936 images for training and
10 images for testing:

[NOTE]
====
Notice the difference between 100 and 936 training images: The accuracy is higher.
