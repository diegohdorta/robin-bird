Robin Bird is a small and flexible machine learning library, written in C++, that
aims to provide simple and extensible implementations of machine learning algorithms
for solving real world problems on embedded systems. Robin Bird provides these
algorithms as simple command-line programs, Python bindings, and C++ classes which
can be used and integrated into low to medium-scale machine learning solutions.
