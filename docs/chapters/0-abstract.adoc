Robin Bird is a small and flexible machine learning library, written in C++, that
aims to provide simple and extensible implementations of machine learning algorithms,
that along with
https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/nxp/user-guides/UM11226.pdf[NXP eIQ(TM) Machine Learning Enablement]
allows ways for solving real world problems on embedded systems. Robin Bird provides
these algorithms as simple command-line programs, Python bindings, and C++ classes which
can be used and integrated into low to medium-scale machine learning solutions.
